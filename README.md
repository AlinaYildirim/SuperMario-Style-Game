# Jump and Run Game

## Description
This project is a Java-based Jump and Run game inspired by classic platformer games like Super Mario. It implements essential game mechanics such as character movement, collision detection, and level design.

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Jump and Run Game
- **Duration:** April 2023 to August 2023
- **Developer:** Alina Yildirim


## Features
1. **Player Movement:** The player can move horizontally (left and right) and jump.
2. **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between the player character and various obstacles like platforms and hazards.
3. **Health System:** The player has a health bar that decreases upon taking damage and can be replenished by collecting health items.
4. **Lives System:** The player has a certain number of lives, which decrease upon taking damage and can be replenished by collecting extra life items.
5. **Level Design:** The game incorporates level design elements such as platforms, lava, and cannons to create challenging levels for the player to navigate.
6. **Graphics:** The game utilizes BufferedImage and Graphics classes for rendering the game environment and player character.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Graphics:** Java's built-in AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries for graphics rendering.
- **Collision Detection:** BufferedImage class for loading level masks and detecting pixel colors for collision detection.
- **External Libraries:** None used in the provided code, as it relies primarily on Java's standard libraries.
